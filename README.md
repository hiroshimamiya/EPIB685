# Course information 
**Restriction**: Open to graduate students in the Environmental Health Sciences or permission of the course instructors. Not open to students who have taken or are taking EXMD 671 or NRSC 671 or PHAR 671.

## Prerequisites
Permission of the instructor. 
Basic understanding in biostatistics and epidemiologic study design is highly recommended. Students who did not complete Introduction to Epidemiology (equivalent to EPIB601), Inferencial Statistics (EPIB 607) and Introduction to Data Analysis in Health Science (understanding in generalized linear models and linear regression - equivalent to EPIB 621) should contact the instructor to obtain required reading materials to prepare for the course.   

## Course format
 - This course is intended to build the foundational knowledge in epidemiologic study design, critical appraisal, data analysis, and communication to investigate and disseminate the population distribution and etiologic association of environmental risk factors on health.  

 -  Methods of instruction will feature in-person lecture and small-group discussion, student-led presentation, and interactive lab session. 

## Learning Objectives 
The primary outcome is to appreciate and interpret environmental epidemiological study designs and research methods. By the end of the course, students should be able to read a published paper in environmental epidemiology and to appreciate the methods and interpret the findings from a population health perspective, while communicating critical public health issues using story maps. 

**Specific learning objectives are:**
- To understand the design and interpretation of the main study designs in environmental epidemiology: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.
- To construct an appropriate epidemiologic research question and devise an appropriate study design using available data that address challenges related to the measurement of environmental data.        
- To Effectively communicate research design and public health issues through story maps and oral presentations .   
- To gain hands-on skills to map the geospatial distribution of environmental risk factors using GIS software and R studio.   
- To understand essential concepts, visualization, and assumptions in time-series study and spatial disease risk estimation.

## Grading Scheme and assignment deadlines 
Many materials in this course are new and take time to learn. Thus the deadlines are pushed toward the end of the course (April). Please plan your time and start working early (study design in particular), so that you will not have to manage multiple deadlines in the last min along with assessments from other courses.

Assignment 2: Story map using ArcGIS Enterprise and peer review              |35% | February 27 | 
Assignment 3: Analysis and visualization of time-series data     |20%  | April 18 |
Assignment 4: Analysis and visualization of  spatial data        |20%  | |


# Accommodations
- Students with demonstratable medical condition(s) that prevents the submission of the written report by the due date and orally present the study should reach the instructor and the SAA - Student Accessibility & Achievement office (SAA https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). SAA will subsequently communicate with the instructor to implement the accommodation.
- Those with an acute medical or non-medical condition that impacts this assignment should reach the instructor as early as possible.

# Assessments

Use of images without proper credit and citation will lead to reduced marks, whether the images are sourced from generative AI, scientific literature, media reports, and the internet. 


### Assignment 1: Critical review of environmental epidemiology studies (group work) (25%)
**Overview**  
With your teammates (approx 2 students, depending on class size), you will be asked to orally present critical appraisal to published environmental epidemiology studies. The research papers to critique will be assigned to students around Week3. 

 - The main objective is to provide you with practice in evaluating the scientific quality of papers from the literature and will thus assist in consolidating study designs taught in the course.    
- The secondary objective is to share your critiques with the class through oral presentation.     
- In addition, this assignment will assist with study design in Assignment 4.   

**Format**:   
  Oral presentation of critical appraisal, approximately 20 minute per group, depending on class size.  




### Assignment 2: Story mapping- mapping exposures and creating narratives using GIS software (25% for your work, and 10% for peer review of other's work)
**Overview**  

- You will geographically map exposures and social determinants of health and potentially health outcomes using GIS (Geographic Information System) and create story a storymap. 
  - The primary objective is to be familiar with GIS software to visualize geospatial data.  
  - The secondary objective is to develop communication skills for the existing public health issues using geospatial images and existing literature and media reports.  
 - In classes 2 and 3, we will go through the use of GIS software and story mapping.   
 - You are asked to submit the story map (graded) to the instructor and present in the class (ungraded) (25%).   
 - You will also provide constructive feedbacks to other's work (10%). 
 - Detailed instructions and grading for map building and peer review  will be provided after GIS workshops.   

**Format**    
   Submission of the story map (graded) and brief presentation (ungraded).   




### Assignments 3 and 4: Analysis, visualization, and interpretation of time-series and areal data (individual work) (20% each)
**Overview**   
  - The primary objective is to understand introductory concepts for geospatial analysis and visualization and the analysis of time-series data.      
  - The secondary objective is to understand challenges associated with spatially and temporally correlated data and perform analysis to account for the dependency of measurement, such as autoregressives models.         
  - The main tasks are to generate maps, time plots, autocorrelation function (ACF), and to estimate constrained and non-constrained distributed lag functions, visualization of results related to assumptions, and interpret the results using (largely pre-written) R codes.
  - The submission format will be R markdown, copy/pasted results, or latex outputs, all in **pdf format**. 
  - Detailed instructions, codes, and data will be provided before and during lectures in time-series and spatial analysis. 
  -Student group who discuss the results in one of the assignments will get extra 10% for each assignment

**Format**:   
  - Submission of pdf file providing results from R studio and written description of findings.    








# Policy around the use of AI technologies for class assignments and presentations  
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to create new types of media, including text, images, software codes, sound, and video in response to user prompts (inputs). Many tools exist that use generative AI to create new content.    

Use of these tools to complete assignments and presentations is permitted as part of learning aids, as long as the three conditions are met:    

   1.   Acknowledge the use of these tools. Specifically, you must cite the creator and the tool in your reference section at the end of your assignment and presentations. Instruction for citation, which you may need to familiarize yourself with future course work, publication, and report writing is provided at https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/    

   2.   Revise and check outputs from these tools carefully. In other words, you cannot copy and paste the crude (unedited) outputs from these tools into your assignments or presentation slides, as the raw responses from these tools tend to be flawed.    

   3.   Submit and present any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool and the prompt (or chain of prompts) used to generate the content as an appendix with their assignments. In your presentation, you must also discuss how the tool was (or will be) used to assist in writing and/or slide making, such that other students can be informed with the effective use of these tools.      


Note: While the use of generative AI tools is permitted in this class, many classes and scientific journals do not allow the use of these tools to generate writing (and any audio and visual contents as well as citations), as their raw outputs are often unreliable and may propagate/amplify misinformation, stigma, and stereotypes. Fact checking is critical when using these tools.   


# University regulations and support 
## Inclusiveness   
I strive to provide an inclusive learning environment. However, if you experience barriers to learning in this course or have any impairments that could impediment your learning, do not hesitate to discuss them with me and/or the Student Accessibility & Achievement Register with Student Accessibility and Achievement -SAA (you can register at https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). Eligibility for SAA is: 
>  Students who are experiencing academic or physical barriers and have a documented disability, mental health condition,chronic health condition, or other impairment. These may be temporary, permanent, or episodic.
> Students with documented disabilities can register at any point in the year, but we recommend registering as early as possible. We encourage students new to McGill to make an appointment before their semester begins.* 

## Language of assessment 
In accordance with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the 
right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.

## Honor code 
 Academic integrity is crucial. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of plagiarism and other academic offenses under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/ for more information).
