# EPIB685: Principles of Environmental Health Sciences

**Restriction(s)**: Open to graduate students in the Environmental Health Sciences or permission of the course instructors. Not open to students who have taken or are taking EXMD 671 or NRSC 671 or PHAR 671.



This course is intended to build the foundational knowledge in population health approaches aimed at evaluating the impact of environmental exposures on health, with a focus on research design, quantitative analysis, and knowledge communication.  
Methods of instruction will feature lectures and interactive lab sessions. Focus will be on the understanding of modern epidemiological research that allows interpreting findings in environmental public health research and performing public health practice. 

## Prerequisites
Permission of the instructor

## Learning Obejctives 
The primary outcome is to appreciate and interpret environmental epidemiological studies. By the end of the course, students should be able to read a published paper in environmental epidemiology and to appreciate the methods and interpret the findings from a population health and policy intervention perspective. 

Specific learning objectives are:    
- To understand the design and interpretation of the main study designs in environmental epidemiology: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.     

- To construct an appropriate epidemiologic research question and devise an appropriate study design using available data.    

- To understand essential concepts in quantitative reasoning, causal inference, and measurement error.    

- To understand and apply the concepts of measurement error and causal reasoning in epidemiology research, including the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs and a counterfactual approach.   

- To Effectively communicate policy-relevant public health evidence, both orally and in writing.     

- Time permitting, a sample of advanced research methods will be covered, including exposure mixture analysis, time-series analysis, geospatial statistics and disease mapping, and location tracking.     
  


## Learning Outcomes
By the completion of this course, students will be able to
      

## Readings and lectures 
Lecture slides will be available in MyCourses.
