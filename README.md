# Course information 
**Restriction(s)**: Open to graduate students in the Environmental Health Sciences or permission of the course instructors. Not open to students who have taken or are taking EXMD 671 or NRSC 671 or PHAR 671.

## Prerequisites
Permission of the instructor. 
Basic understanding in biostatistics and epidemiologic study design is highly recommended. Students who did not complete Introduction to Epidemiology (equivalent to EPIB601), Inferenceial Statistics (EPIB607) and Introduction to Data Analysis in Health Science (understanding in generalized linear models) - equivalent to EPIB621 should contact the instructor to obtain required reading materials to prepare for the course.   

## Course description
This course is intended to build the foundational knowledge in epidemiologic approaches to investigate the population distribution and etiologic association of environmental risk factors on health, with a focus on research design and critical appraisal.  

Methods of instruction will feature lectures, student-led presentations, and an interactive lab session. The focus will be on the understanding and critical appraisal of modern epidemiological research. 

## Learning Objectives 
The primary outcome is to appreciate and interpret environmental epidemiological study designs and research methods. By the end of the course, students should be able to read a published paper in environmental epidemiology and to appreciate the methods and interpret the findings from a population health perspective. 

Specific learning objectives are:    
- To understand the design and interpretation of the main study designs in environmental epidemiology: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.
- To construct an appropriate epidemiologic research question and devise an appropriate study design using available data that address challenges related to the measurement of environmental data.        
- To Effectively communicate research design and public health issues through storymaps and oral presentations .   
- To gain hands-on skills to map the geospatial distribution of environmental risk factors using GIS software and R studio.   
- To understand essential concepts, visualization, and assumptions in time-series study and spatial disease risk estimation.

# Accommodations
- Students with demonstratable medical condition(s) that prevents the submission of the written report by the due date and orally present the study should reach the instructor and the SAA - Student Accessibility & Achievement office (SAA https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). SAA will subsequently communicate with the instructor to implement the accommodation.
- Those with an acute medical or non-medical condition that impacts this assignment should reach the instructor as early as possible.

# Assignments 

Use of images without proper credit and citation will lead to reduced marks, whether the images are from generative AI, scientific literature, media reports, and the internet. 

## Assignment 1: Story mapping- mapping exposures anbd creating narratives using GIS software (25%)
You will geographically map exposures and social determinants using GIS (Geographic Information System) and create story a story map. 
The objective is to be familiar with GIS software and geospatial data. 
The secondary objective is to develop communication skills for the existing public health issues using geospatial images and existing litrature and media reports. 
In Class (Week) 2 and 3, we will go through the use of GIS software and story mapping.   
You are asked to submit the storymap (graded) to the instructor and present to the class (ungraded).   

## Assignment 2: Critical review of environmental epidemiology studies (group work) (25%)
With your teammate (2-3 students, depending on class size), you will be asked to provide a presentation for an environmental epidemiology study. The research papers to critique will be assigned to students in Week 5. 

The main objective is to provide you with practice in evaluating the scientific quality of papers from the literature and will thus assist in consolidating and integrating the material taught in the course. This will also assist with the planning of the project (Assignment 3). 

**Format**: 
  - The presentation of your critical appraisal is approximately 20 minute per group, depending on class size.  

The presentation should comprise the following elements: 

1. Objectives: are the (if any) objectives clearly stated? Are they supported by the introduction and commensurate with the study design that follows? Justify your response. If the 
objective is not in PICO (PECO) format, please rewrite it accordingly.

3. Population: Describe the target and study populations.
 
4. Study design: What is the specific design? Is the design consistent with how the source population reflects the target population? Be specific in terms of how data were collected. If appropriate, create a graphical timeline of the study with important time points.

5. Identification of subjects and recruitment: Define the sources/processes used to identify and recruit subjects, including any inclusion/exclusion criteria; indicate the size of the study and participation rates, if provided.

6. Health outcomes: Describe what health outcomes were investigated and how they were ascertained, possible issues with validity/reliability, and measurement scales used (e.g., continuous, categorical).

7. “Exposures”: Describe what “exposures” were measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

8. Potential confounding factors: Describe what factors were measured, how they were measured, possible issues with validity/reliability, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical). Were any important variables omitted?

9. Statistical analysis: Briefly describe what statistical methods were used to analyze the data, what factors were included in the models, and what assumptions were made.

10. Results: Describe the main results, referring to the parameters that were estimated. Please ensure that you provide a clear description of the meaning of these results and what assumptions were made. Were the results presented in such a way that they reflected clearly the objectives of the study?

11. Conclusions: Strengths and weaknesses of the study, and possible conclusions and implications to public health and medical evidence towards regulatory policy and/or clinical practice. Do you agree with the authors’ interpretation of the results? Is the information presented sufficient for you to draw your own conclusions? Do they differ from the authors’

12. Potential alternative study design(s)

References can be used to support your points. 

Bonus question (additional 1% of total mark): What are the specific biological/physiological/psychological mechanisms in which the exposure acts on the outcome? This is often described in the paper, either in the introduction or the Discussion section. If not stated in your paper, you can find it from the literature.
Another bonus question (additional 1% of total mark): Can you create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that displays the relationships between the exposure(s), outcome, and the confounders discussed in the paper?

References can be used to support your points.

Marks will be assigned to the 10 components above uniformly (thus 2% of the total mark for each point for the oral presentation, plus 2% for the bonus questions). Same for the written report.

Some points, in particular statistical analysis, may be challenging to grasp and present confidently and concisely (hence, I added the bonus questions to make up this challenge). You can reach the instructor or TA for any clarification and information to present. Note that students cannot get greater than 20% (oral presentation) and 25% (written report) of the total mark even if all questions and bonus questions are addressed perfectly.







## Assignment 3: Data analysis and visualization (individual work) (25%)
  - The primary objective is to understand introductory concepts for geospatial analysis and visualization and the analysis of time-series data.      
  - The secondary ofjective is to understand challenges associated with spatially and temporally correlated data.         
  - The main tasks are generate maps, time plots, visualization of results related to assumptions, and interprete the results using (largely pre-written) R codes. 
  - The submmission format will be R markdown, copy/pasted results, or latex outputs, all in **pdf format**. 







## Assignment 4: Study design (group work) (25%)
Using any of the exposure(s) mapped in Assignment 1 in Montreal, student groups will formulate a hypothetical study design integrating the materials learned from the course, with a focus on study design and measurement (less focus on statistical analysis).    

If your team is not proposing standard etiologic study designs (studies other than case-control, cohort, and time-series), you should first consult the instructor and TA, since rationalizing ecological and cross-sectional study require strong understanding in available data.   
Literature can be used to rationalize the study aim, study design, and data analysis.   

**Overview of the task**   
 - Students will formulate a hypothetical study design integrating the materials learned from the course in a group, with a focus on selecting and rationalizing appropriate study design that meet the measurments and subject matter interest. 
 - The study design should address and elaborate on the points below (see Specific Instruction - similar points to Assignment 2).
 - With your teammate, you will be asked to provide a presentation and written review for other groups' presentations. Your groups will critique two other groups's presentations to provide constructive feedback- group assignment for peer critique will be uploaded to MyCourses   

**Learning Objectives**
 - The main objectives are: To design an environmental epidemiologic study and to consolidate and integrate the material learned in the course.
 - To provide opportunities to share various environmental epidemiologic studies and topics with other groups for a broader understanding.   
- To practice the formulation of constructive feedback to aid other groups' study design.

**Format**: 
  - Presenting group (Assignment 4a): 20 min of presentation (3a), followed by 5 minutes of questions, conditional on the number of groups. 
  - Reviewing groups (Assignment 4b): At least 7 suggestions to critique, per presentation  (3b)Single-spaced document 


### Assignment 4a - Presentation of project (15%)

 - Students can use any of the exposure(s), but using exposures mapped in Assignment 1 are research goal is a good start.

 - If your team is not proposing standard etiologic study designs (e.g., studies other than case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and ecological), you should first consult the instructor and TA.

- As in Assignment 2, generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) can be used to assist in writing and slide-making if you make appropriate acknowledgments and provide specific use of these tools (including written prompts) in the report and oral presentation. This is to inform other students of the effective use of these tools in writing a report. See the specific policy regarding the use of AI technologies in the course Syllabus.

**Specific points to address (gradine scheme)** (Assignment 4a) should follow the following components: 
1. Background section including problem statement and the importance of the study design (justification). Why do you think your research question is important?   
   
   -**There is no need to perform thorough literature review to identify your problem at all**. Any environmental issue of your interest that provides a valid hypothesis is fine. Ideally, the project will be based on your story map from Assignment 1. 

2. Objective: Clearly state the study objective supporting your research question in the PICO format.The objective must be feasible and attainable

3. Study design: justification of choice and brief overview. And reasons not using any other study designs. 

4. Population: describe the target population and the intended study population. Describe any criteria for inclusion/exclusion and justify.

5. Identification of subjects and recruitment: define the sources to be used to identify and, if relevant, recruit subjects; explain potential problems and expected participation rates.

6. Exposures: describe what exposures will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, types of measurement errors, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

7. Health outcomes: describe what health outcomes are to be studied, how they will be ascertained, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, types of measurement errors, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

8. Potential confounding factors: describe what accepted or potential risk factors will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).
9. Brief description of statistical analysis and expected results

10. Conclusions and discussion: Strengths and weaknesses of the study and possible conclusions/contributions and relationship to public health.

11. References - any format is fine. 

12. Table and figures (optional)

**Grade** in Assignment 4a will depend on the first 10 points above, each with equal weight. 


You can find relevant research designs, problem statements and discussions to follow from journls such as: 
   -*Environmental Health Perspectives, Environmental Health, Environment International, Epidemiology, Environmental Epidemiology, and Environmental Science & Technology*    


### Assignment 4b - Review of other projects (10%)
  - Your group will be assigned two* projects from other groups to review.   
  - Based on the presentation slides and oral presentation, your team will provide constructive review and suggestions to your peer groups. 
  - The submitted oral presentation from other groups will not be graded, but the quality of your group's reviews will be. The course instructor will review and provide additional feedback needed to make sure that everyone receives adequate and useful guidance. 
- **Grade** will be determined based on the clarity and accuracy of the feedbacks. 
*The number to review is subject to class size. 




# Policy around the use of AI technologies for class assignments and presentations  
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to create new types of media, including text, images, software codes, sound, and video in response to user prompts (inputs). Many tools exist that use generative AI to create new content. 
Some examples include ChatGPT and Bing (text generation) and Midjourney and DALL-E (image generation).   

Use of these tools to complete assignments and presentations is permitted as part of learning aids, as long as the three conditions are met:    

   1.   Acknowledge the use of these tools. Specifically, you must cite the creator and the tool in your reference section at the end of your assignment and presentations. Instruction for citation, which you may need to familiarize yourself with future course work, publication, and report writing is provided at https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/    

   2.   Revise and check outputs from these tools carefully. In other words, you cannot copy and paste the crude (unedited) outputs from these tools into your assignments or presentation slides, as the raw responses from these tools tend to be flawed.    

   3.   Submit and present any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool and the prompt (or chain of prompts) used to generate the content as an appendix with their assignments. In your presentation, you must also discuss how the tool was (or will be) used to assist in writing and/or slide making, such that other students can be informed with the effective use of these tools.      


Note: While the use of generative AI tools is permitted in this class, many classes and scientific journals do not allow the use of these tools to generate writing (and any audio and visual contents as well as citations), as their raw outputs are often unreliable and may propagate/amplify misinformation, stigma, and stereotypes. Fact checking is critical when using these tools.   


# University regulations and support 
## Inclusiveness   
I strive to provide an inclusive learning environment. However, if you experience barriers to learning in this course or have any impairments that could impediment your learning, do not hesitate to discuss them with me and/or the Student Accessibility & Achievement Register with Student Accessibility and Achievement -SAA (you can register at https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). Eligibility for SAA is: 
>  Students who are experiencing academic or physical barriers and have a documented disability, mental health condition,chronic health condition, or other impairment. These may be temporary, permanent, or episodic.
> Students with documented disabilities can register at any point in the year, but we recommend registering as early as possible. We encourage students new to McGill to make an appointment before their semester begins.* 

## Language of assessment 
In accordance with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the 
right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.

## Honor code 
 Academic integrity is crucial. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of plagiarism and other academic offenses under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/ for more information).
