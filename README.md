# Course information 
**Restriction(s)**: Open to graduate students in the Environmental Health Sciences or permission of the course instructors. Not open to students who have taken or are taking EXMD 671 or NRSC 671 or PHAR 671.

## Prerequisites
Permission of the instructor. 
Basic understanding in biostatistics and epidemiologic study design is helpful, but not required. 

## Course description
This course is intended to build the foundational knowledge in epidemiologic approaches to investigate the population distribution and etiologic association of environmental risk factors on health, with a focus on research design and critical appraisal.  
Methods of instruction will feature lectures, student-led presentations, and an interactive lab session. The focus will be on the understanding of modern epidemiological research that allows interpreting findings in environmental public health research. 

## Learning Objectives 
The primary outcome is to appreciate and interpret environmental epidemiological study designs and research methods. By the end of the course, students should be able to read a published paper in environmental epidemiology and to appreciate the methods and interpret the findings, from a population health and policy intervention perspective. 

Specific learning objectives are:    
- To understand the design and interpretation of the main study designs in environmental epidemiology: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.
- To understand threads to the validity of population health research: bias and confounding
- To construct an appropriate epidemiologic research question and devise an appropriate study design using available data.    
- To understand essential concepts in quantitative reasoning and causal inference.    
- To Effectively communicate policy-relevant public health evidence, both orally and in writing.   
- To gain hands-on skills to map the geospatial distribution of environmental risk factors.   
- Time permitting, a sample of advanced research methods will be covered, including exposure mixture analysis, time-series analysis, geospatial analysis and disease mapping, and location tracking.     
  

## Course time and location
Friday 9:35AM-12:35PM EST, interrupted by a 10-15minutes break. All teaching is in-person (subject to COVID-related regulations), and lectures will be recorded by ZOOM. 

Please arrive to class on time and stay until the end of the class. Chronically arriving late or leaving class early will disrupt the learning of peer students.
    
## Readings and lectures 
Lecture slides will be available in MyCourses. 
There is no one text for this course – lectures benefit articles provided in the class.

# Evaluation Components and Student Tasks
### Assignment 1: Simple mapping of exposures in Montreal using GIS software (individual work) 
You will map urban exposures and social determinants of health in Montreal using GIS (Geographic Information System). 
The objective is to be familiar with GIS software and geospatial data. 
In Class (Week) 3 and 4, we will go through the use of GIS software using example data.  

### Assignment 2 a and b Critical review of environmental epidemiology study (group work)
With your teammate (2-3 groups of students, depending on class size), you will be asked to provide an oral presentation and written description evaluating an environmental epidemiology study. 
The research papers to critique will be assigned to students in Week 5. 

The main objective of this component is to provide you with practice in evaluating the scientific quality of papers from the literature and will thus assist in consolidating and integrating the material taught in the course. This will also assist with the final project. 

Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) can be used to assist writing, if appropriate acknowledgment is made, and the specific use of these tools, including written prompts, are provided in the report and presentation. See the policy regarding the use of AI technologies below.  

**Length**: The critique should be about 2 pages (suggested, excluding references) with single space and can be written out using bullets if you prefer, ensuring that the flow is logical. The critique should comprise the following elements: 

1. Objectives: are the (if any) objectives clearly stated? Are they supported by the introduction and commensurate with the study design that follows? Justify your response. If the 
objective is not in PICO format, please rewrite it accordingly.

3. Population: Describe the target and study populations.
 
4. Study design: What is the specific design? Is the design consistent with how the source population reflects the target population? Be specific in terms of how data were collected. If appropriate, create a graphical timeline of the study with important time points.

5. Identification of subjects and recruitment: Define the sources/processes used to identify and recruit subjects, including any inclusion/exclusion criteria; indicate the size of the study and participation rates, if provided.

6. Health outcomes: Describe what health outcomes were investigated and how they were ascertained, possible issues with validity/reliability, and measurement scales used (e.g., continuous, categorical).

7. “Exposures”: Describe what “exposures” were measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

8. Potential confounding factors: Describe what factors were measured, how they were measured, possible issues with validity/reliability, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical). Were any important variables omitted?

9. Statistical analysis: Briefly describe what statistical methods were used to analyze the data, what factors were included in the models, and what assumptions were made.

10. Results: Describe the main results, referring to the parameters that were estimated. Please ensure that you provide a clear description of the meaning of these results and what assumptions were made. Were the results presented in such a way that they reflected clearly the objectives of the study?

11. Conclusions: Strengths and weaknesses of the study, and possible conclusions and implications to public health and medical evidence towards regulatory policy and/or clinical practice. Do you agree with the authors’ interpretation of the results? Is the information presented sufficient for you to draw your own conclusions? Do they differ from the authors’

References can be used to support your points. 


### Assignment 3a-c: Project proposal (Group work)
Using any of the exposure(s) mapped in Assignment 1 in Montreal, students will formulate a hypothetical study design integrating the materials learned from the course. 

If your team is not proposing standard etiologic study designs (e.g., study other than case-control, cohort, ecological, time-series), you should first consult the instructor and TA. 
Literature can be used to rationalize study aim, study design, and data analysis. 

**Format**: 
  - 3 min presentation of initial project proposal (ungraded)
  - 15-20 min of presentation (3a), followd by  
  - At least 5 suggestions to critique, per presentation  (3b)
  - Single space document, 3 or 4 pages for written project proposal, excluding reference and tables/figures (optional) (3c)


Presentation of project proposal (3 minutes, ungraded) should provide: 
  1. Research question and its public health importance.    
  2. Objective 
  3. Study design
  3. Population, exposure and outcome


Review of other projects (Assignment 3b)
Your group will be assigned two projects from other groups to review. Based on the presentation slides and oral presentation, your group will provide constructive review and suggestions. The details of this will be discussed in class. The submitted presentation and oral presentation will not be assessed, but the quality of your group's reviews of others’ will be. The course instructors will review and provide additional feedback of needed to make sure that everyone receives adequate and useful guidance in order to finalise their project proposals


Presentation and written project proposal (3a and 3c) should follow the following components: 
1. Background section including problem statement and the importance of the study design (justification). Why do you think your research question is important? 
  E.g., The impact of your urban exposure(s) X on your health outcome Y on your population Z is not well known, so a study is needed to motivate further research.   
  You can find problem statment from journls such as: 

  ..*Environmental Health Perspectives, Environmental Health, Environment International, Epidemiology, Environmental Epidemiology, and Environmental Science & Technology*    


  ..**There is no need to perform a through review to identify your problem**. Any environmental issue of your interest that provides a valid hypothesis is fine. 

2. Objective: Clearly state the study objective supporting your research question in the PICO format.The objective must be feasible and attainable

3. Study design: justification of choice and brief overview.

4. Population: describe the target population and the intended study population. Describe any criteria for inclusion/exclusion and justify.

5. Identification of subjects and recruitment: define the sources to be used to identify and, if relevant, recruit subjects; explain potential problems and expected participation rates.

6. Exposures: describe what exposures will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, types of measurement errors, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

7. Health outcomes: describe what health outcomes are to be studied, how they will be ascertained, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, types of measurement errors, and measurements scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

8. Potential confounding factors: describe what accepted or potential risk factors will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).
9. Brief description of statistical analysis and expected results

10. Conclusions and discussion: Strengths and weaknesses of the study and possible conclusions/contributions and relationship to public health.

11. References - any format is fine. 

12. Table and figures (optional)





# Policy around the use of AI technologies for class assignments and presentation  
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to create new types of media, including text, images, software codes, sound, and video in response to user prompts (inputs). Many tools exist that use generative AI to create new content. 
Some examples include ChatGPT and Bing (text generation) and Midjourney and DALL-E (image generation).   

Use of these tools to complete assignments and presentations is permitted as part of learning aids, as long as the three conditions are met:   

    1.   Acknowledge the use of these tools. Specifically, you must cite ChatGPT in your reference section at the end of your assignment and presentations. Instruction for citation, which you may need to familiarize yourself for future course work, publication, and report writing is provided at https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/    

    2.   Revise and checked responses from these tools carefully. In other words, you cannot copy and paste the crude (unedited) outputs from these tools into your assignments or presentation slides, as the raw responses tend to be flawed.    

    3.   Submit any content produced by an artificial intelligence tool and the prompt (or chain of prompts) used to generate the content as an appendix with their assignments.    


Note: While the use of generative AI tools is permitted in this class, many classes and scientific journals do not allow the use of generative AI in writing and image creation, as their raw outputs are often unreliable (hence, do not use unchecked outputs in this class) and often propagate stigma and stereotypes targeted to vulnerable individuals. 


# University regulations and support
