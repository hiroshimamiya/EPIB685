# EPIB685: Principles of Environmental Health Sciences

**Restriction(s)**: Open to graduate students in the Environmental Health Sciences or permission of the course instructors. Not open to students who have taken or are taking EXMD 671 or NRSC 671 or PHAR 671.



This course is intended to build the foundational knowledge in population health approaches aimed at evaluating the impact of environmental exposures on health, with a focus on research design and critical appraisal.  
Methods of instruction will feature lectures and interactive lab sessions. Focus will be on the understanding of modern epidemiological research that allows interpreting findings in environmental public health research and performing public health practice. 

## Prerequisites
Permission of the instructor

## Learning Obejctives 
The primary outcome is to appreciate and interpret environmental epidemiological study designs and research methods. By the end of the course, students should be able to read a published paper in environmental epidemiology and to appreciate the methods and interpret the findings, from a population health and policy intervention perspective. 

Specific learning objectives are:    
- To understand the design and interpretation of the main study designs in environmental epidemiology: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies.
- 
- To understand threads to the validity of population health research: bias and confounding

- To construct an appropriate epidemiologic research question and devise an appropriate study design using available data.    

- To understand essential concepts in quantitative reasoning and causal inference.    

- To Effectively communicate policy-relevant public health evidence, both orally and in writing.     

- Time permitting, a sample of advanced research methods will be covered, including exposure mixture analysis, time-series analysis, geospatial analysis and disease mapping, and location tracking.

## Evaluation Components


### Assignment 1:  Critical review of environmental epidemology study  

Students will be asked to provide: 
  A written description and critique that we will assign to you of an environmental epidemiological study, completed by each student. 
  Class presentation by a group of 5 students, 

**Objective of the exercise**: The main objective of this component is to provide you with practice 
in evaluating the scientific quality of papers from the literature and will thus assist in 
consolidating

**Length**: The critique should be about 2 pages (suggested) and can be written out using bullets, 
ensuring that the flow is logical. The critique should comprise the following elements: 

1. Objectives: are the (if any) objectives clearly stated? Are they supported by the introduction 
and commensurate with the study design that follows? Justify your response. If the 
objective is not in PICO format, please rewrite accordingly.

3. Population: Describe the target and study populations.
 
4. Study design: What is the specific design? Is the design consistent with how the source 
population reflects the target population? Be specific in terms of how data were collected. 
If appropriate, create a graphical timeline of the study with important time points.

5. Identification of subjects and recruitment: Define the sources/processes used to identify 
and recruit subjects, including any inclusion/exclusion criteria; indicate the size of the 
study and participation rates, if provided.

6. Health outcomes: Describe what health outcomes were investigated and how they were 
ascertained, possible issues with validity/reliability, and measurement scales used (e.g., 
continuous, categorical).

7. “Exposures”: Describe what “exposures” were measured, possible issues with 
validity/reliability of measuring these, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, 
categorical).

8. Potential confounding factors: Describe what factors were measured, how they were 
measured, possible issues with validity/reliability, measurement scales (e.g., continuous, 
categorical). Were any important variables omitted?

9. Statistical analysis: Briefly describe what statistical methods were used to analyse the data, 
what factors were included in the models, and what assumptions were made.

10. Results: Describe the main results, referring to the parameters that were estimated. Please 
ensure that you provide a clear description of the meaning of these results and what 
assumptions were made. Were the results presented in such a way that they reflected clearly 
the objectives of the study?

11. Conclusions: Strengths and weaknesses of the study, and possible conclusions and 
relationship to clinical practise, public health and/or policy. Do you agree with the authors’ 
interpretation of the results? Is the information presented sufficient for you to draw your 
own conclusions? Do they differ from the authors’
