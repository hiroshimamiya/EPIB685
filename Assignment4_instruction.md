## Assignment 4: Study design (group work) (25%)
**Overview**  
Using any of the exposure(s) mapped in they prefer or from Assignment 1, students will formulate and rationalize a hypothetical study design by integrating the materials learned from the course.    

Source of data (outcome, confounders, and exposure) can be the existing cohorts and environmental measurements introduced in the lecture, and you can propose your own data collection as sampling under cohort or case-control schemes.   

If your team is not proposing standard etiologic study designs (studies other than case-control, cohort, and time-series), you should first consult the instructor and TA, since rationalizing ecological and cross-sectional study require strong understanding in available data and risks lower marks from this assignment.    
Literature can be used to rationalize the study aim, study design, and data analysis.   

**Tasks**   
 - Students will formulate a hypothetical study design integrating the materials learned from the course in a group, with a focus on selecting and rationalizing appropriate study design that meet the measurements and subject matter interest. 
 - The study design should address and elaborate on the points below (see Specific Instruction - similar points to Assignment 2).
 - With your teammate, you will be asked to provide a presentation of your own proposal and also written reviews for other groups' presentations. Your groups will critique two other groups's presentations to provide constructive feedback- group assignment for peer critique will be uploaded to MyCourses   

**Learning Objectives**
 - The main objectives are: To design an environmental epidemiologic study and to consolidate and integrate the material learned in the course.
 - To provide opportunities to share various environmental epidemiologic studies and topics with other groups for a broader understanding.   
- To practice the formulation of constructive feedback to aid other groups' study design.

**Format**: 
  - Presenting group (Assignment 4a): approximately 20 min of presentation (3a), followed by 5 minutes of questions, conditional on the number of groups. 
  - Reviewing groups (Assignment 4b): at least 7 suggestions to critique, per presentation (3b)Single-spaced document based on the example template for critical appraisal.  


### Assignment 4a - Presentation of project (15%)

 - Students can use any of the exposure(s), but using exposures mapped in Assignment 1 are research goal is a good start.

- As in Assignment 1 and 2, generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT or image generators) can be used to assist in slide-making if you make appropriate acknowledgments and provide specific use of these tools (including written prompts) in the report and oral presentation. If you do not cite images you borrow from the internet, AI, or existing articles, you will lose marks. 

**Specific points to address (grading scheme)** (Assignment 4a) should follow the following components: 
1. Background section including problem statement and the importance of the study design (justification). Why do you think your research question is important?   
   
   -**There is no need to perform thorough literature review to identify your problem at all**. Any environmental issue of your interest that provides a valid hypothesis is fine. Ideally, the project will be based on your story map from Assignment 1. 

2. Objective: Clearly state the study objective supporting your research question in the PICO format.The objective must be feasible and attainable

3. Study design: justification of choice and brief overview. And clear reasons not using any other study designs. 

4. Population: describe the target population and the intended study population. Describe any criteria for inclusion/exclusion and justify.

5. Identification of subjects and recruitment: define the sources to be used to identify and, if relevant, recruit subjects; explain potential problems and expected participation rates.

6. Exposures: describe what exposures will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, types of measurement errors, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

7. Health outcomes: describe what health outcomes are to be studied, how they will be ascertained, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, types of measurement errors, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

8. Potential confounding factors: describe what accepted or potential risk factors will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).
9. Brief description of statistical analysis and expected results

10. Conclusions and discussion: Strengths and weaknesses of the study and possible conclusions/contributions and relationship to public health.

11. References - any format is fine. 

12. Table and figures (optional)

**Grade** Assignment 4a will depend on the first 10 points above, each with equal weight (thus 15%/10 of final grade). 


You can find relevant research designs, problem statements and discussions to follow from journals such as: 
   -*Environmental Health Perspectives, Environmental Health, Environment International, Epidemiology, Environmental Epidemiology, and Environmental Science & Technology*    


### Assignment 4b - Review of other projects (10%)
  - Your group will be assigned two* projects from other groups to review.   
  - Based on the presentation slides and oral presentation, your team will provide constructive review and suggestions to your peer groups. 
  - The submitted oral presentation from other groups will not be graded, but the quality of your group's reviews will be. The course instructor will review and provide additional feedback needed to make sure that everyone receives adequate and useful guidance. 
- **Grade** will be determined based on the clarity and accuracy of the feedbacks. 
*The number to review is subject to class size, likely likely to be two presentations.
