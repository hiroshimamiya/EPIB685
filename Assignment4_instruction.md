## Assignment 4: Study design (group work) and peer review  (25%)

**Overview of tasks**  
- The assignment consists of two parts: 
   - (a) Presentation of study design 
   - (b) Written review of peer groupsâ€™ design during presentation. Your group will give constructive feedback to another groups' presentation. 


Based on an environmental health topic of interest (can pick from Assignment 1), students will formulate and rationalize a hypothetical study design by integrating the materials learned from the course.  

 The source of data (outcome, confounders, and exposure) can be the existing cohorts and environmental measurements introduced in the lecture (recall the mini-group exercises 1 and 2), or you can propose your own data collection as sampling under cohort or case-control schemes if you are ambitious.   

 During peer review, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions to ensure that your review will capture critical points. 

This is group work, and new group assignments for second-year students will be announced shortly (1st year students will maintain the same group as Assignment 2).  




**Overview of grading**  
Your group will be graded based on the quality of study design for (a) as assessed by the instructor. Your quality of review for another groups (b) will also be assessed by the Instructor and TA. 

- Note that, while the instructor and TA will grade both (a) and (b), **peer group review will influence the instructor's grading for (a), that is, if your presentation for (a) is unclear e.g., too wordy and does not elicit useful review from the assigned peer group or instructor, your task (a) will receive lower mark. In other words, clarity of slides and presentation, in particular the use of images to highlight critical parts of the design and illustrate study design is critical**. 



**Learning Objectives**
 - The main objectives are: To design an environmental epidemiologic study and to consolidate and integrate the material learned in the course.
 - To provide opportunities to share various environmental epidemiologic studies and topics with other groups for a broader understanding.   
- To practice the formulation of constructive feedback to aid other groups' study design.





## Submission format
  - Presenting group (Assignment 4a): no more than 20 min of presentation (3a), followed by 5 minutes of questions, conditional on the number of groups. 
  - **Deadline**: For fairness, all groups, regardless of the week of presentation, must send the slides to the instructor on the first presentation week (April 4) 9:35 AM. **Your group's work will be disqualified if not submitted before the deadline**. 

  - Reviewing groups (Assignment 4b): Follow the example template below for critical appraisal, per presentation (3b). 
  - There is no need to upload the written reviews to myCourses, as it is group work. The groups can email the review document to the instructor. To be graded, the filename should state your group number and the number of groups that were reviewed. 

## Evaluation criteria, Assignment 4a - Presentation of project (15%)

Exceeding the presentation time will lead to a **5% reduction of grade from this assignment (out of a total of 25%)**. This is because a longer presentation will exhaust reviewers and thus negatively impact the grading of peer reviews conducted by other groups as well as your own presentation. 

**Also, those who show up late in the class and disturb the peer presentation will lose 5% (out of 25%) of their grade**. 

Students can use any of the exposure(s), but using exposures mapped in Assignment 1 is a good and convenient start.

If you are unsure whether your design matches to the research question of interest, you are encouraged to verify your choice with the instructor. Picking a wrong study will lead to the major loss of marks in this assignment, as all aspects of the study (e.g., bias, statistical analysis) will be irrelevant if a wrong design is selected. 




**Specific points to address (grading scheme)** (Assignment 4a) should follow the following components. **You will receive the points only if they are presented in a clear manner in talk and slides**. 

1. Background section including problem statement and the importance of the study design (justification). Why do you think your research question is important?   
   
   -There is no need to perform a thorough literature review to identify your problem. Any environmental issue of your interest that provides a valid hypothesis is fine. Ideally, the project will be based on your story map from Assignment 1. 

2. Objective: Clearly state the study objective supporting your research question in the PICO format. The objective must be feasible and attainable

3. Study design: justification of choice and brief overview. And clear reasons not using any other study designs. 
**This is the most critical step of the assignment, and not getting the right study design will lead to cascading failure for the rest of the points below i.e., your overall grade will be very low.** 

4. Population: describe the target population and the intended study population. Describe any criteria for inclusion/exclusion and justify. 

5. Identification of subjects and recruitment: define the sources to be used to identify and, if relevant, recruit subjects; explain potential problems and expected participation rates.

6. Exposures: describe what exposures will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, types of measurement errors, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

7. Health outcomes: describe what health outcomes are to be studied, how they will be ascertained, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, types of measurement errors, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

8. Potential confounding factors: describe what accepted or potential risk factors will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with validity/reliability of measuring these, and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).
9. Brief description of statistical analysis and expected results

10. Conclusions and discussion: Strengths and weaknesses of the study and possible conclusions/contributions and relationship to public health.

13. credits and references. As in Assignments 1 and 2, generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT or image generators) can be used to assist in slide-making if you make appropriate acknowledgments and provide specific use of these tools (including written prompts) in the report and oral presentation. If you do not cite images you borrow from the internet, AI, or existing articles, you will lose marks. 

**Slide format will influence your grade**    
  The use of images and tables is critical. **Even if you address all the points above, if you do not deliver the contents in a straightforward and clear manner, your overall mark will be low**, as the instructor will not be able to properly assess your work. In addition, your peer reviewers would not be able to elicit proper review if the slides are too wordy and the presentation is not appropriately paced, which will lead to incomplete peer review and negatively impact your presentation's grade as well as peer groups's review assessment. 

**Grade** Assignment 4a will depend on the first 10 points above, each with equal weight (thus 15%/13 of the final grade). 

Finally, you can find relevant research designs, problem statements and discussions to follow from journals such as: 
   -*Environmental Health Perspectives, Environmental Health, Environment International, Epidemiology, Environmental Epidemiology, and Environmental Science & Technology*    



## Evaluation criteria, Assignment 4b -Review of two other projects (10%)
  - The oral presentation from other groups will not be directly graded by you, but the quality of your group's reviews will be. However, the quality of your review may indirectly influence the instructor's grading of the presentation, if there are valid points that are missed by the instructor but found by your groups. 

  - Your group will be assigned at least one peer group presentation to review.   
  
  - The evaluation will be determined based on the clarity and accuracy of the feedbacks.
    - Clarity: **if the review is not clear, your group will lose marks**. 
    - Accuracy: **if your review misses critical limitations associated with the points below, there will be a loss of marks. Also, if your review raises limitations/suggestions that are totally irrelevant and obviously incorrect, they will reduce marks**.
    - Thus, you are strongly encouraged to ask questions after the presentation, to ensure that your review provide valid feedback. 


**Points to address**. However, if the presenting groups did an absolutely perfect job answering these, you can state so and do not need to provide limitation/suggestion.   
1.  Background section including problem statement and the importance of research question in terms of solving existing environmental issues i.e., Why do they think the research question is important?

2.  Objective: Is the study objective clearly stated in the PICO/PECO format and the time period of interest? Also, the objective must be feasible and attainable. 

3.  Study design: justification of choice for the given exposure and outcome.

4.  Population: Is there a description of the target population, intended study population, and the source population to recruit the sample? Description of any criteria for inclusion/exclusion?

5.  Identification of subjects and recruitment: Is there a proper definition of the sources to be used to identify and, if relevant, recruit subjects? If they are using an existing cohort (see examples of existing cohorts in Class 2 - part I of Cohort Study), did they justify their selection of the cohort?

6.  Selection bias: Did the group describe the potential of selection bias in your study and how you will mitigate this? 

7.  Exposures: A clear definition of the exposure(s) and the description of how the exposure(s) will be measured, possible issues with measurement errors and misclassification (information bias), and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical). 

8.  Health outcomes: A clear definition of health outcome(s) to be studied and how they will be measured, possible issues with measurement errors and misclassification (information bias), and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).

9.  Clear rationale to identify potential confounding factors: describe what accepted or potential risk factors will be measured, how they will be measured, and possible issues with the validity/reliability of measuring these.

10. Appropriateness of statistical analysis 

11. Area there a clear description of the strengths and weaknesses of the study? 

12.  Is there possible conclusions/contributions and relationships to public health that the study could generate?

**Submission format**    
 - Write comments to each point above for the group(s) assigned to you and provide inputs to any limitations or points to improve. Your group need to email documents. There is no need to upload to myCourses. 
 - The documents need to contain your group number and the group ID to be reviewed on the header, to be graded.
