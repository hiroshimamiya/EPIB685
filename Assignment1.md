### EPIB685 Winter2024: Principles of Environmental Health Sciences II

#### Assignment 1 Instruction (5% of total mark)

#### Due Jan 30th, midnight. 
- Students with a medical condition(s) that prevents the completion of the assignments by the due date should reach the instructor and the SAA - Student Accessibility & Achievement office (SAA https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). SAA will subsequently communicates with the instructor to implement the accommodation.      
- Those with an acute medical or non-medical condition that impacts this assignment should reach the instructor as early as possible.      
- Late submission will lead to 0.5% reduction of the total mark a day, up to 5% (thus, after the 10th day from Jan 30th, the student will lose 5% of your total mark for the whole term).      

#### Submission 
Please upload to myCourses, and if the site is not working, please email the assignment as an attachment to the instructor with the subject line stating `EPIB685 Assignment 1`.   

#### Instruction 
1. Select two exposures of your choice and map them in QGIS (see Class 2 for the instructions for mapping).    
As shown in the instructions, you must create the gradient of each exposure associated with each explore file provided in MyCourses. In other words, your two maps should replicate the exposure gradient seen in the example maps in the file uploaded to myCourses in Week 3 lecture folder, named `DataPrep_Exposome_hiroshiExample_additionalExposures`. 

All files have a column (variable) starting with "Ex" or 'Exposure' recording the spatial intensity of each exposure. 

Take the snapshot of your maps with reasonable image resolution such that you can appreciate the details of urban exposure distribution.    

2. For each map, add a 1 or 2-paragraph of concise description about the spatial distribution of your exposure. Your description for the 2 maps should not exceed a 1-page single space letter size document.     
  You can, for instance, describe whether the observed geospatial distribution of your exposures is expected or unexpected, and if so, why/why not.    
  You can also describe the type of population that may be most intensely exposed to your exposure of interest based on your knowledge of the demography of Montreal.    

3. Attach the description and the exposure gradient maps in a single document and submit.      

#### Grading scheme    
50% for mapping the spatial distribution of your two exposures.     
50% for whether your description supports and aligns with the maps of the spatial distribution of exposures or not.    

#### Questions
In Week 4 (26th of January), we will have a brief Q and A sessions for Assignment 1.
