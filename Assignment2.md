### Assignment 2a (presentation) and 2b: Critical review of environmental epidemiology study 





**Accommodations**      
    - Students with a medical condition(s) that prevents the submission of the written report by the due date should reach the instructor and the SAA - Student Accessibility & Achievement office (SAA https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). SAA will subsequently communicate with the instructor to implement the accommodation.    
    - Those with an acute medical or non-medical condition that impacts this assignment should reach the instructor as early as possible.     


    


**Learning Objectives**:   
The main objectives are: 
    To provide you with practice in evaluating the scientific quality of papers from the literature and thus assist in consolidating and integrating the material learned in the course. 
    To assist in the planning for Assignment 3. 
    To provide opportunities to share various environmental epidemiologic studies with other groups for a broader understanding of study design and subject matters (e.g., air pollution and built environment)  


With your teammate (3-4 students per group), you will be asked to provide a presentation and a written review for an environmental epidemiology study assigned to your group.   



Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) can be used to assist in writing and slide preparation if you make appropriate acknowledgments and provide specific use of these tools (including written prompts) in the report and oral presentation. This is to inform other students the effective use of these tools in writing a report. See the specific policy regarding the use of AI technologies in the course Syllabus.  

**Format**: 
  - Presentation (Assignment 2a) No more than 20 min of oral presentation (2a), followed by 5 minutes of questions (thus 25 Minutes x 6 groups = 150 min,  plus ~20 min of break).

  - Written report (Assignment 2b) About 2 pages (suggested, can be longer, excluding references) with single space and can be written out using bullets if you prefer, ensuring that the flow is logical.

  - Late submission of the written report will lead to a 2.5% reduction of the total mark a day, up to 25% (thus, after the 10th day of the deadline, the student will lose 25% of your total mark for the whole term).

  - While the written report will be prepared in group, each student will submit the report individually through MyCourses. The report can be identical across teammates, but slight variation is okay too if you would like to add additional interpretations and critiques beyond what is discussed within the group.

  - To be graded, students are expected to be present **in person** on the day of the oral presentation (March 22nd). If unable to make it, please contact the instructor ASAP to search for the possibility of a hybrid presentation (this is less likely to happen though, given the complexity of setting up a hybrid group talk that could lead to technical challenges and thus delays subsequent presentations that impact grading of all the groups). 


  

After the presentation, the instructor, TA, and other groups will provide feedback and questions. Your group has an opportunity to incorporate these suggestions into the written reports 

**Specific Instruction**:   
The presentation and written report should comprise the following elements: 

1. Objectives: are the (if any) objectives clearly stated? Are they supported by the introduction and commensurate with the study design that follows? Justify your response. If the 
objective is not in PICO (PECO) format, please rewrite it accordingly.

2. Population: Describe the target and study populations, and if possible source population   
 
3. Study design: What is the specific design? Is the design consistent with how the source and study population reflect the target population? Be specific in terms of how data were collected. If appropriate, create a graphical timeline of the study with important time points.    

4. Recruitment or identification of study participants: Define the sources/processes used to identify and recruit subjects, including any inclusion/exclusion criteria; indicate the size of the study and participation rates, if provided.    

5. Health outcomes: Describe what health outcome(s) was investigated and how they were ascertained, possible issues with validity/reliability, and measurement scales used (e.g., continuous, categorical).   

6. “Exposures”: Describe what exposure(s) were measured and how. Describe possible issues with the validity/reliability of measuring these and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).   

7. Potential confounding factors: Describe what factors were measured and how they were measured. Were any important variables omitted? Are including some confounders questionable (follow the 3 criteria of confounder?   

8. Statistical analysis: Briefly describe what statistical methods were used to analyze the data. What effect estimates were used (e.g., rate ratio, odds ratio, risk ratio, hazard ratio, etc). How were confoundeders addressed? And what assumptions were made?

9. Results: Describe the main results, referring to the measures of association(s) that were estimated. Try ensure that you provide a clear description of the meaning of these results and what assumptions were made. Were the results presented in such a way that they reflected clearly the objectives of the study?   

10. Conclusions: Strengths and weaknesses of the study, and possible conclusions and implications to public health and medical evidence towards regulatory policy and/or clinical practice. Do you agree with the authors’ interpretation of the results? Is the information presented sufficient for you to draw your own conclusions? Do they differ from the authors’   

Bonus question: What are the specific biological/physiological/psychological mechanisms in which the exposure acts on the outcome? This is often described in the paper, either in the introduction or the Discussion section. If not stated in your paper, you can find it from the literature.   

References can be used to support your points. 

Marks will be assigned to the 10 components above uniformly (thus 2% of the total mark for each point for the oral presentation, plus 2% for the bonus questions). 

Some points, in particular statistical analysis, may be challenging to grasp and present confidently (hence, I added the bonus question to make up this challenge). You can reach the instructor or TA for any clarification and what information to present.
