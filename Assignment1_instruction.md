## Assignment 1: Story mapping- mapping exposures and creating narratives using ArcGIS Enterprise or or other GIS software (25%)
**Overview**  

- You will geographically map exposure(s) and optionally (though strongly encouraged) social determinants of health and health outcomes (may be challenging to get data) using GIS (Geographic Information System) and create a story map, a narrative supplemented and enhanced by map and multimedia.  

- The *primary objective* is to be familiar with GIS software to visualize geospatial data. 
- The *secondary objective* is to develop communication skills for the existing public health issues using geospatial images and existing literature and media reports.   

 - In Class (Week) 2 and 3, we will go through the use of GIS software and story mapping.   
 - You are asked to submit the story map (graded) to the instructor and present in the class (ungraded).   
 - Detailed instructions and grading scheme will be provided after GIS workshops.       
 - You will work individually or in a pair. However, working by yourself is recommend, if you are to use the product for your portfolio to demonstrate your skills, just like being the first author counts most in a paper.   



**Format**    
 - Submission of the story map (graded) and brief presentation (ungraded).   
 - The product needs to contain at least one map element and have a clear, cohesive, and engaging story. It does not need to be interactiv as long as enhanced by an uploaded shape file(s). 
  - It can be any length and have as many maps and media as you like; however, the story needs to be simple, clear, and targeted (see evaluation below). Complicated webpage and unclear message will repel or misinform the audience. 

**How to submit** 
If using Arc Enterprise portal, save in the EPIB 685 shared folder in the portal and make it accessible to users in this group, or keep in your folder but make it accessible to the instructor. 





## Story map evaluation criteria  

**1\.Map**
 1. Have map(s) converted from a shape file.     
 2. Maps are from credible source and properly cited. You cannot just use a map from unrecognized media source and paste.     
 3. Map is properly projected -recall distortion from the workshop (unprojected map look quite distorted, so you will clearly notice if it requires fix) 


**2. Clarity of Purpose:**      

4. Clearly defines the objective of the story map. The objective can be stated in the start of your storytelling starting with "Objective" (you can remove the statement after the evaluation, if you intend to modify or use as part of resume).      
5. Clearly state the target audience. You need to state the target audience in the slide. Intended audience are, academia, general public, policymakers, trainees (graduate, undergraduate, elementary school or below, parents, family members etc). Normally, you do not create a story for more than two audiences. 

**3. Storytelling: engages the audience with a coherent and compelling narrative - story needs to be simple and tailored to the target audience. This is similar to writing your brief in business or in public health**   
    
6. Story needs to be simple with one key message.  
7. It needs to provide a clear statement about the significance of your issue (e.g., burden of environmental risk factor on health) so that audience will be engaged.
8. Provides adequate context for the topic, including background and relevance to the audience.
9. It should end with discussion or statement about the societal, environmental, or cultural implications of the storymap's topic
10. Optional (bonum mark) add actionable insights or policy recommendations for the problem you present. 


9. It needs to have a logical flow of content with clear connections between maps, text, and multimedia (if applicable).
10. It cannot be overloaded with technical details and gimmicks (too many menus) for accessibility to a broader audience.

**4. Accessibility and Aesthetics**     
    11. It should not have any visually disturbing components (flashing screen, a primary color dominating the page).  
    12. Ideally (optional, ungraded) make it color-blindness friendly, as it will create a disparity in information outreach.   
    13. Avoid using hard to read fonts (too small, to atypical font styles)

**5. Credits**   
    14.  All images (even those generated by AI) must be cited and credited, including the one you make (credit yourself). Likewise, any text quotes, multimedia, research paper must be cited properly.  
If appropriate, includes a bibliography or reference section. 

The grade distribution is uniform across the points above (except optional ungraded component)


The core of good story mapping is same as writing: we need to create a simple and creative message that draws the attention of audiences. The only exception is that we have a map to use, since visual information helps simplify relatively complex idea while engaging and navigating readers.
