### Assignment 3a, 3b, and 3c: Research project development  

**Accommodations**       
    -    Students with a medical condition(s) that prevents the submission of the written report by the due date and orally present the study should reach the instructor and the SAA - Student Accessibility & Achievement office (SAA https://www.mcgill.ca/access-achieve/). SAA will subsequently communicate with the instructor to implement the accommodation.    
    -    Those with an acute medical or non-medical condition that impacts this assignment should reach the instructor as early as possible.     

**Deadlines**   
See syllabus. 

    
**Overview of the task**   
Students will formulate a hypothetical study design integrating the materials learned from the course in a group.     

The study design should address and elaborate on the points below (see Specific Instruction - similar points to Assignment 2).      

With your teammate from Objective 3, you will be asked to provide a presentation, and written review for other groups' presentations, and a written report for the study design. 


**Learning Objectives**     
The main objectives are: 
    To practice the designing of environmental epidemiologic study and to consolidate and integrate the material learned in the course.   
    To provide opportunities to share various environmental epidemiologic studies and tipics with other groups for a broader understanding.   
    To practice the formulation of constructive feedbacks to aid other groups' study design.   


**Instruciton to start**  
Students can use any of the exposure(s) mapped in Assignment 1 and the population in Montreal as the target population and outcome of interest. It is also possible to use any populations (e.g., outside Canada, global health) or exposure not covered in the class (e.g., pesticide, light, blue space).       

If your team is not proposing standard etiologic study designs (e.g., studies other than case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and ecological), you should first consult the instructor and TA.     

As in Assignment 2, generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) can be used to assist in writing and slide-making if you make appropriate acknowledgments and provide specific use of these tools (including written prompts) in the report and oral presentation. This is to inform other students the effective use of these tools in writing a report. See the specific policy regarding the use of AI technologies in the course Syllabus.     



**Tasks and format**   
  - Assignment 3a (15% of course grade): Presentation. No more than 20 min of oral presentation (2a), followed by 5 minutes of questions (thus 25 Minutes x 6 groups = 150 min,  plus ~20 min of break).   

  - Assignment 3b (15%): Your groups will critique two other groups to provide constructive feedback (3b) - group assignment for peer critique will be released in early March. At least 5 suggestions should be provided per presentation, though more is better to help your peer groups polish their final report. Single-spaced document.      

  - Assignment 3c (20%):3 or 4 pages for a written project, excluding reference and tables/figures (optional) (3c). Single space. While this is group work, student will submit their own written individually to myCOurses.  

After the presentation, the instructor, TA, and other groups will provide feedback and questions. Your group has an opportunity to incorporate these suggestions into the written reports.   


**Points to address in presentation, critical review, and written report**:   

Presentation and written description of the project (Assignment 3a and 3c) should follow the following components:

1. Background section including problem statement and the importance of your group's research question in terms of solving existing environmental issues i.e., Why do you think your research question is important?    

  -There is no need to perform a thorough review to identify your problem. Any environmental issue of your interest that provides a valid hypothesis is fine.   

2. Objective: Clearly state the study objective supporting your research question in the PICO/PECO format and the time period of interest. The objective must be feasible and attainable    

3. Study design: justification of choice and brief overview.    

4. Population: describe the target population, intended study population, and the source population to recruit the sample. Describe any criteria for inclusion/exclusion and justify.  

5. Identification of subjects and recruitment: define the sources to be used to identify and, if relevant, recruit subjects. If you are using an existing cohort (see examples of existing cohorts in Class 2 - part I of Cohort Study ), justify your selection of the cohort.  

6. Selection bias: describe the potential of selection bias in your study and how you will mitigate this.  

7. Exposures: describe what exposures will be measured, how they will be measured, possible issues with measurement errors and misclassification (information bias), and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).    

8. Health outcomes: describe what health outcomes are to be studied, how they will be measured, possible issues with measurement errors and misclassification (information bias), and measurement scales (e.g., continuous, categorical).    

9. Potential confounding factors: describe what accepted or potential risk factors will be measured, how they will be measured, and possible issues with the validity/reliability of measuring these. 

10. Brief description of statistical analysis and expected results

11. Conclusions and discussion: Strengths and weaknesses of the study and possible conclusions/contributions and relationship to public health that the study could generate.    

You can find relevant research designs, problem statements and discussions to follow from journals such as: -Environmental Health Perspectives, Environmental Health, Environment International, Epidemiology, Environmental Epidemiology, and Environmental Science & Technology

References - any format is fine.
Tables and figures (optional, but visualization is always helpful)
References should be used to support your points, especially the Background section.  


**Grading scheme**    
- Bonus mark (2% of course grade): If your group uses a different study design from the paper in your Assignment 2 i.e., those who did case-control in Assignment 2 will work on the cohort in Assignment 3 to get an extra 2% for the course.  

-- As in Assignment 2, grades will be equally broken across the points above e.g., for Assignment 3a, 15%/11  of the course grade.
